## Introduction

React is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Facebook that makes it easy to build reusable UI components. It allows developers to build fast, scalable, and dynamic web applications with a component-based architecture. React focuses on the "View" in MVC (Model-View-Controller) and can be used in single-page applications (SPAs).

## Installation

To get started with React, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

### Create a React App

The easiest way to start a React project is by using **Create React App**, a command-line tool that sets up everything you need to start building with React.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will launch the development server and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

State
State is an object that represents the dynamic data of a component. Unlike props, state can be modified within the component, and it allows for interactive and dynamic UIs.

Example:

jsx
Copy code
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
Lifecycle Methods
React components have lifecycle methods that allow you to run code at different stages of a component's existence, such as when it's mounted or updated. Common lifecycle methods include:

componentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate()
componentWillUnmount()
These methods are primarily used in class components.

Hooks
Hooks are a relatively new addition to React (introduced in version 16.8) that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include:

useState for managing state
useEffect for handling side effects
Example:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
Routing
React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables the navigation between different pages and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

Install React Router:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-router-dom
Example:

jsx
Copy code
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
