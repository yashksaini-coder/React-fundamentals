## Introduction

React is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Facebook that makes it easy to build reusable UI components. It allows developers to build fast, scalable, and dynamic web applications with a component-based architecture. React focuses on the "View" in MVC (Model-View-Controller) and can be used in single-page applications (SPAs).

## Installation

To get started with React, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

### Create a React App

The easiest way to start a React project is by using **Create React App**, a command-line tool that sets up everything you need to start building with React.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will launch the development server and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
